## 1. implement the payement gateway
    - a user signs up and choses a subscription that they intend to apply for
    - if the user doesnt subscribe, they dont have access to the application.
    - for user who use visa payements, they are offered a 21 days free trial
    - implement a feature to block abuse of free trials
    - users who are going to pay via mobile money can not have free trials(because its easier to implement an automatic subscription with visa payements than mobile money payments)
    - users should be allowed to cancle subscriptions.
    - make sure that users only access what they pay for

## 2. Implement the notification system.
    - The user should recieve notifications for the dates of different things from farrow dates to vaccination dates.

## 3. Create a user account management.
    - allow the user to manage their own account
    - adding email address
    - adding mobile numbers, for the invoice
    - adding farm name, for the invoice 
    - adding profile picture(just for use within the app) and logo(for the invoice)
